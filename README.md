# ORM_Ecommerce_Backend

In this challenge, we are given the opportunity to test api routes and how they can be used to generate new user content in a database.

Combining JavaScript, SQL and Insomnia, we were given a handful of products, their categories, and their tags as starter code to work off of for our content in our database. The SQL is mainly used for connecting to the database and from there, the seeds are stored in JavaScript syntax instead of SQL syntax. This allows the process of coding to be more efficent since information is allocated into less files and you can code in a language that is more comfortable for you to use as a developer.

Once the connecting syntax was made and the commands were run in the terminal, the data was ready to be interpreted in Insomnia. In Insomnia, the user is able to manipulate the database by using JavaScript commands such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. From here the user can view all of the Categories, Products or Tags in the database at the same time or by specific id, they can create new ones, update existing ones, and delete existing ones from the database. Insomnia simulates a front-end application that can be used in a workplace to update their companies current databases. 

Overall, this challenge was very useful in understanding the connection of api routes and real world applications of back-end programming.
